    "4. **Location & Time**: Clearly derive environment from the script (e.g. INT DAY, DON'S OFFICE, etc.). Describe it in its details (size, lighhting, mood, organization of the objects, etc.). Notice that if it's the same across the different scenes, it must be written in the same way\n",

    "- Each character must have the name and a short description (consistent from provided descriptions).\n",

The description must be succint, without extra articles or words, it should be visual and useful for an image generation prompt. Ensure it makes sense with the shot type (e.g., if it's medium shot, don't say that the face is covering the full image, otherwise it should be a close up).\n",
