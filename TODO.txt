TODO (actually: TOIMPROVE)

- Lens classifier
    - Try using label smoothing as hyperparameter 
    - Try different LR schedulers
    - Change way in which noise is added in training (aking to training of diffusion models)
    - Have a classifier with more shot types (e.g. angles, specific director styles, etc.)
